    "# Lalal.ai Downloader and Merger\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a Python-based solution for downloading audio segments exported from Lalal.ai and merging them into a single audio file. It supports both vocals and no-vocals playlists and works seamlessly in Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- **URL or File ID Input**: Accepts either a full URL or a file ID for processing.\n",
    "- **Flexible Playlist Selection**: Allows users to choose between vocals or no-vocals playlists.\n",
    "- **Automated Download**: Sequentially downloads all available segments.\n",
    "- **Audio Merging**: Combines downloaded segments into a single MP3 file.\n",
    "- **Colab Integration**: Designed for use in Google Colab with built-in file download support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before running the notebook, install the necessary dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install pydub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "1. **Extract File ID**:\n",
    "   - Open the developer console in your browser (e.g., press `F12` in Chrome).\n",
    "   - Go to the **Network** tab and play the converted song.\n",
    "   - Locate the segment URLs and right click, copy and copy the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Notebook**:\n",
    "   - Input either a full URL or the extracted file ID when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose Playlist**:\n",
    "   - Specify whether you want the vocals (`yes`) or no-vocals (`no`) playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Download and Merge**:\n",
    "   - The script will download all segments and merge them into `merged_audio.mp3`.\n",
    "   - The merged file will be available for download directly from Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Input\n",
    "- URL:  \n",
    "  `https://d.lalal.ai/media/split/298a10ab-c995-488b-899c-3c81e2118c9c/ebb93a82-85ba-4f9f-b8d1-2b675e021bef/vocals_playlist/segment-000.mp3`\n",
    "- File ID:  \n",
    "  `298a10ab-c995-488b-899c-3c81e2118c9c/ebb93a82-85ba-4f9f-b8d1-2b675e021bef`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- Individual segments downloaded to the `segments` directory.\n",
    "- Merged audio saved as `merged_audio.mp3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Ensure the song is fully converted on Lalal.ai to access all segments. The script won't work on preview segments.\n",
    "- The script automatically downloads and merges available segments.\n"
